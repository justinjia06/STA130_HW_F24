    "### Research question 1: \n",
    "Is there a correlation between someone’s mental health and their views on being single?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables:**\n",
    "WELLNESS_satisfied_single\n",
    " - categorical (not satisfied, slightly not satisfied, satisfied, slightly satisfied, very satisfied)\n",
    " - Visualization: Bar plot to show how many people chose each level of satisfaction\n",
    "WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health\n",
    " - discrete (rate from 1(bad) - 10(great))\n",
    " - Visualization: Bar plot to show how many people chose each rating of mental health\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "Use fisher’s exact test on a 5x10 contingency table to calculate the exact probability of obtaining the observed distribution of values assuming the null hypothesis is true\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:**\n",
    "Null hypothesis: There is no correlation between self-rated mental health and satisfaction with being single.\n",
    "Alternative hypothesis: There is a correlation between self-rated mental health and satisfaction with being single.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:**\n",
    "If p-value < 0.05: reject the null hypothesis -> significant association \n",
    "If p-value >= 0.05: fail to reject the null hypothesis -> no significant association \n",
    "The results will help determine if there is a relationship between attitudes toward being single and their mental health\n",

    "Does weight affect your happiness?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables:**\n",
    "WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_happy\n",
    " - Discrete (rate from 1(sad) - 10(happy))\n",
    " - Visualization: Bar plot to show how many people chose each level of happiness\n",
    "DEMO_weight\n",
    " - Continuous ( 0(probably not) - infinity(definitely not))\n",
    " - Visualization: violin plot to see the distribution shape and density of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "Simple linear regression to analyze the potential effect of weight on a person's happiness score. Where happiness=β0+β1×Weight+ϵ\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:**\n",
    "Null hypothesis: There is no relationship between weight and happiness, slope of the regression line is zero\n",
    "Alternative hypothesis: There is a relationship between weight and happiness, slope of the regression line is not zero\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:**\n",
    "If p < 0.05: We reject the null hypothesis -> statistically significant relationship \n",
    " - If β1>0 -> as weight increases, happiness increases.\n",
    " - If β1<0 -> as weight increases, happiness decreases.\n",
    "If p >= 0.05: We failed to reject the null hypothesis -> no statistically significant relationship\n",
    "The results will help determine if there is a relationship between weight and self percieved happiness\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research question 3:\n",
    "Does someone's gender affect how attractive they think they are\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables:**\n",
    "DEMO_gender\n",
    " - Categorical (male, female, whatever else)\n",
    " - Visualization: bar plot to see how many individuals fall under each gender category\n",
    "PSYCH_body_self_image_questionnaire_think_unattractive\n",
    " - Ordinal (5 categories)\n",
    " - Visualization: bar plot to see the count of values in each category\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "Use fisher’s exact test on a 5 x (however many genders there are) contingency table to calculate the exact probability of obtaining the observed distribution of values assuming the null hypothesis is true\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:**\n",
    "Null hypothesis: There is no association between gender and self-perception of unattractiveness\n",
    "Alternative hypothesis: There is an association between gender and self-perception of unattractiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:**\n",
    "If p < 0.05: We reject the null hypothesis -> statistically significant relationship \n",
    "If p >= 0.05: We failed to reject the null hypothesis -> no statistically significant relationship\n",
